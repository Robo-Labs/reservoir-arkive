## About Reservoir

Reservoir Finance is dedicated to developing groundbreaking solutions that optimize capital efficiency. In order to achieve this goal, we foster a culture of rigorous risk assessment and open discussion. Unlike many existing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that heavily depend on centralized and opaque entities, our aim is to minimize lack of clarity, risk, and security. By doing so, we seek to enhance DeFi's product offerings and construct a more transparent and inclusive cryptocurrency ecosystem.
